NULL VALUES:

How do we select only the records with NULL values in the "Address" column?

We will have to use the IS NULL operator:

SELECT LastName,FirstName,Address FROM Persons
WHERE Address IS NULL


The result-set will look like this:


LastName	FirstName	Address
Hansen	Ola	 
Pettersen	Kari	 



SQL IS NOT NULL
How do we select only the records with no NULL values in the "Address" column?

We will have to use the IS NOT NULL operator:

SELECT LastName,FirstName,Address FROM Persons
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL

The result-set will look like this:

LastName	FirstName	Address
Svendson	Tove	Borgvn 23

SQL ISNULL(), NVL(), IFNULL() and COALESCE() Functions
Look at the following "Products" table:

P_Id	ProductName	UnitPrice	UnitsInStock	UnitsOnOrder
1	Jarlsberg	10.45	16	15
2	Mascarpone	32.56	23	 
3	Gorgonzola	15.67	9	20
Suppose that the "UnitsOnOrder" column is optional, and may contain NULL values.

We have the following SELECT statement:SQLSERVER

SELECT ProductName,UnitPrice*(UnitsInStock+ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder,0))
FROM Products

In the example above, if any of the "UnitsOnOrder" values are NULL, the result is NULL.

Microsoft's ISNULL() function is used to specify how we want to treat NULL values.

The NVL(), IFNULL(), and COALESCE() functions can also be used to achieve the same result.

In this case we want NULL values to be zero.

Below, if "UnitsOnOrder" is NULL it will not harm the calculation, because ISNULL() returns a zero if the value is NULL:


or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:

SELECT ProductName,UnitPrice*(UnitsInStock+COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder,0))
FROM Products
